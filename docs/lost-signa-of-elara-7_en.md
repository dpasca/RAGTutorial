The Lost Signal of Elara-7
In the year 2247, the mining colony on Elara-7, a dusty moon orbiting a gas giant in the Orion Arm, went silent. The last transmission, received by the Galactic Survey Network (GSN) on April 3rd, was a garbled message from Chief Engineer Mara Kade: "The core’s awake… it’s not what we thought… send help." Then, nothing—no distress beacon, no automated pings, just the hum of empty space.

The colony had been operational for 12 years, extracting rare isotopes from Elara-7’s volcanic crust to fuel humanity’s sprawling interstellar empire. Its 1,200 residents were a mix of engineers, geologists, and their families, living in a network of pressurized hab-domes. The GSN dispatched the scout ship Icarus Dawn to investigate, crewed by Captain Elias Vorn, Dr. Lena Tariq (a xenobiologist), and Technician Jax Pell.

When the Icarus Dawn arrived on April 15th, they found the colony intact but abandoned. The hab-domes were eerily pristine—meals left half-eaten, tools scattered mid-use, and personal logs frozen on mundane entries. The mining rig, a massive drill boring into the moon’s core, was still running, its AI muttering cryptic status updates: "Containment stable. Entity designation: unknown."

Dr. Tariq’s scans revealed faint bio-signatures deep beneath the surface, where the drill had breached a sealed chamber. The team descended, finding a cavern lined with pulsating, crystalline structures that emitted a low-frequency hum. Jax, analyzing the drill’s logs, uncovered a chilling detail: the colony’s isotope readings had spiked tenfold in the days before the silence, coinciding with the drill hitting this chamber.

Captain Vorn pieced together Mara Kade’s final log, stored in a damaged terminal: "We thought it was a power source. It’s alive. It’s learning us. We can’t stop it." The log cut off as the crystals in the cavern began to glow brighter, and the Icarus Dawn’s comms started broadcasting static—echoing Mara’s last words.
